  <h2>üåº About Us</h2>
  <p><strong>FF:</strong> FFBond</strong> is a curious researcher based at the University of Toronto, where he's diving headfirst into the wild and wonderful world of <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>. His current passion project blends deep learning with biological sequence data ‚Äî think DNA meets transformers, with a sprinkle of model magic.</p>

  <p>When he's not training models or decoding contigs, you can find FF lining up a perfect shot on the billiards table üé±, or enjoying a lovingly home-cooked meal by Xiaomei (his all-time favorite chef and teammate in both life and science üç≤üíñ).</p>

  <p>He believes that science, like cooking, is about balancing precision with creativity ‚Äî and that a well-trained neural network and a well-marinated chicken share more in common than most people realize.</p>
  <p>Current goal: publish a great paper and learn how to flip a perfect pancake ü•û with one hand ‚Äî ideally not at the same time.</p>


  <p><strong>Xiaomei:</strong> Xiaomei</strong> is a developmental psychology researcher who finds joy in studying how humans grow, change, and sometimes confuse even themselves along the way. She's currently working under the guidance of Professor <strong>Kang Lee</strong>, where her research explores the fascinating intersections of childhood cognition, honesty, and emotional development.</p>

  <p>Outside the lab, Xiaomei transforms into a culinary artist ‚Äî she loves cooking warm, comforting meals that often earn her the title of ‚ÄúMaster Chef‚Äù from FF. Her idea of a perfect day? A walk under golden-hour sunshine, a cat or two trailing behind, and maybe a new theory forming quietly in her mind.</p>

  <p>She has a special affection for <strong>small cats</strong>, fluffy blankets, and meaningful conversations. Some say she has the soul of a poet trapped in a scientist's lab coat ‚Äî and maybe they're right. üêæ‚òÅÔ∏è</p>


  <p><strong>Professor Lambo:</strong> Lambo is a blue Abyssinian born in February 2025, and the undisputed chaos coordinator of our household lab. He may not hold a PhD (yet), but he insists on reviewing every research manuscript by walking directly across the keyboard.</p>

  <p>By day, he provides emotional support to our deep learning models (through loud purring and screen-sitting), and by night, he observes human behavior ‚Äî especially FF playing pool or Xiaomei experimenting with tofu textures.</p>

  <p>His key contributions include interrupting Zoom calls, meowing during statistical analysis, and making sure no one takes themselves too seriously. We believe his attention span is shorter than a K-mer, but his heart is as big as a multi-omics dataset.</p>

  <p>Research interests: ribbon physics, box theory, interpretability of snacks. Long-term goal: become first author on a paper titled <em>‚ÄúPredicting Tuna Arrival Using Reinforcement Learning‚Äù</em>.</p>

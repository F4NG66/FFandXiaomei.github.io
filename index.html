  <h2>👨‍🔬 About FF</h2>
  <p><strong>FFBond</strong> is a curious researcher based at the University of Toronto, where he's diving headfirst into the wild and wonderful world of <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>. His current passion project blends deep learning with biological sequence data — think DNA meets transformers, with a sprinkle of model magic.</p>
  <p>When he's not training models or decoding contigs, you can find FF lining up a perfect shot on the billiards table 🎱, or enjoying a lovingly home-cooked meal by Xiaomei (his all-time favorite chef and teammate in both life and science 🍲💖).</p>
  <p>He believes that science, like cooking, is about balancing precision with creativity — and that a well-trained neural network and a well-marinated chicken share more in common than most people realize.</p>
  <p>Current goal: publish a great paper and learn how to flip a perfect pancake 🥞 with one hand — ideally not at the same time.</p>

<section id="about-xiaomei" class="about-section">
  <h2>👩‍🍳 About Xiaomei</h2>
  <p><strong>Xiaomei</strong> is what you'd get if you blended a developmental psychologist, a part-time cat whisperer, and a full-time culinary philosopher. She studies how children grow, feel, lie (adorably), and tell the truth when no one’s looking — all under the brilliant mentorship of Professor <strong>Kang Lee</strong>.</p>
  <p>When she's not decoding childhood cognition, Xiaomei is usually stirring a magical pot in the kitchen, humming to her sauces and sprinkling spice like she's casting a protection spell. Her cooking powers fuel both FF’s late-night coding and Lambo’s very judgmental taste buds.</p>
  <p>Her favorite things include: warm rice, small spoons, fluffy cats, and taking walks where most of the thinking happens in her socks. If science is the mind, Xiaomei brings the soul (and snacks) 🍙🧠💕</p>

<section id="about-lambo" class="about-section">
  <h2>🐱 About Professor Lambo</h2>
  <p><strong>Lambo</strong> is a blue Abyssinian born in February 2025, and the undisputed chaos coordinator of our household lab. He may not hold a PhD (yet), but he insists on reviewing every research manuscript by walking directly across the keyboard.</p>
  <p>By day, he provides emotional support to our deep learning models (through loud purring and screen-sitting), and by night, he observes human behavior — especially FF playing pool or Xiaomei experimenting with tofu textures.</p>
  <p>His key contributions include interrupting Zoom calls, meowing during statistical analysis, and making sure no one takes themselves too seriously. We believe his attention span is shorter than a K-mer, but his heart is as big as a multi-omics dataset.</p>
  <p>Research interests: ribbon physics, box theory, interpretability of snacks. Long-term goal: become first author on a paper titled <em>“Predicting Tuna Arrival Using Reinforcement Learning”</em>.</p>
